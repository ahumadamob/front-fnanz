# Gradient Able Image Assets

Add the following theme image files before packaging the application. Keep the original filenames so the existing references remain valid:

- logo.png
- logo-dark.png
- logo-icon.png
- loading.gif

These binaries were removed from version control to satisfy repository policies. Store them securely (for example in an internal asset registry or design system bucket) and copy them into this folder when setting up the project locally.
